          <div >Go Workshop</div>

          <!--<p><b>NOTE</b>: REGISTRATIONS FOR THE GO WORKSHOP IS NOW CLOSED.</p>-->

          <p>GopherConIndia 2016 is proud to work with <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/" target="_blank"></a>Ardan Labs</a> to bring to you a full day of the Hardcore Go workshop on Thursday, 18th Feb. 2016, a day before the actual GopherConIndia conference.</p>
          <p>This is a 1 day class for any level developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go. This class provides an intensive and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including topics ranging from language syntax, Go's type system, concurrency, channels and more. We believe this class is perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals. We would love to have you attend this paid workshop. Lunch and snacks will be provided.</p>
          <p><b>Note</b>: <em>The proceeds of the Go workshop will go towards part-funding the conference</em>.</p>

          <!-- <div >Signup</div> -->
          <!-- <p>Pay only Rs. 9999.00 or US$ 170 (for international participants) now. <b>This price is for the workshop <em>and</em> 2 days of the conference</b>.</p> -->

<!--<p>GopherConIndia is celebrating the month of January, 2015 as "Gopher Month", wherein we will conduct Free Go workshops to increase the awareness of the Go Programming Language within the student community in India.</p>-->
<p>Cory LaNou who works at @influxDB in an <a href="http://www.gophercon.in/blog/2014/09/06/coryinterview/" target="_blank">interview with GopherConIndia</a>, says that the best way to get a real jump on the Go language is to either <em>attend a Go workshop</em>, meetup, or find somebody that is willing to pair with you who is already experienced with Go.</p>

<div >Testimonial</div>
<p>William Kennedy had held the same Go workshop at the first-ever GopherConIndia 2015. One of the participants <b>Ms Sinny Kumari</b> had this to say about the workshop:</p>

<div class="row speaker">

  <div class="col-sm-10">
    <p class="about-speaker">
     I have attended few workshops, the Go workshop by William Kennedy was one of them which was organized a day before GopherConIndia 2015. I never expected that as a newbie to Go, I will understand a completely new programming language in one day. He explained different core concepts of Go very well, starting from writing Hello World to using Concurrency. Every concept was explained with examples and gave us time to do hands-on in order to get comfortable with Go coding. Teaching material used by him were very well prepared consisting of basic to advanced examples for each topic. While attending the next two days' awesome talks at GopherconIndia, I never felt clueless during a talk. This workshop gave me lot of confidence and a right path to explore further the wonderful Go language. <b>I highly recommend people to attend his workshop</b>.

<div >What do you need?</div>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Mac, Windows, or Linux-based Laptop</p>

<p>Go runs great in all these environments, so any laptop you&#39;re comfortable using will do. Get your laptop to the workshop. We&#39;ll help you get everything installed on your system so you&#39;ll learn in the same environment where you&#39;ll actually write your own Go programs.</p>

<div >Up-to-date Web Browser</div>
<p>We designed the online experience to take advantage of some of the latest web standards, so you&#39;ll need the latest version of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or IE.</p>

<div >Who teaches this course?</div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet" target="_blank">William Kennedy</a> is a managing partner at Ardan Studios in Miami, FL, a mobile and web app development company. He is also a co-author of the book <a href="http://www.goinactionbook.com/" target="_blank">Go In Action</a>, the author of the blog <a href="http://www.goinggo.net/" target="_blank">GoingGo.Net</a> and the organizer for the Go and MongoDB Meetups in Miami. He is focused on Go education and through his new venture <a href="http://www.goinggotraining.net/" target="_blank">GoingoGo Training</a>, he continues the cause by working with individuals and groups who want to take their Go knowledge and coding skills to the next level.</p>

<div >What will you learn?</div>

<p>We take a tour of the language. We learn the keywords, built-in functions and syntax. We also explore what is idiomatic and how the language is very orthogonal. This includes following the community standards for coding and style.</p>
